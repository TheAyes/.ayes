  "Punchline": "Redefining FFXIV navigation with unlimited, precise waymarks.",
  "Description": "Splatoon is a powerful accessibility tool. It revolutionizes gameplay with its custom waymark system, offering the ability to create unlimited grouped waymarks, labels, and actor indicators with exacting pixel precision. This feature empowers players by making crucial objects and events more visually discernible, thereby facilitating quicker reactions. However, it's important to note that the plugin does not come pre-loaded with presets. Players have the freedom to craft their own or import existing ones, offering a personalized touch to their gaming experience.",
  "Changelog": "- \"Face player\" options extended\n- - \"<tethered>\" placeholder, facing an object(s) that is tethered to current\n- - \"Invert\" option was added. Instead of facing target, target will face object.\n- Target alteration option added\n- - Redirects draw towards another object selected by condition, such as \"Tethered\", \"Targeted\", \"Furthest/Nearest\".\n- - Conditions still checked against original object\n- Element's distance limit can now be checked against other object selected by placeholder. Checking against captured element is also supported.\n- Realtime tether option. Instead of checking historical event of receiving tether, will check whether an object has a tether at this specific moment of time. \n- $TETHER placeholder was added.\n- Dragonsong's Reprise phase will now be detected and set automatically, even after disconnects and in replays too.\n- Triggers can now be disabled without being removed\n\nAll together, these changes should remove need to use scripts for most of the tethers, furthest/nearest objects and complex positional checks.
